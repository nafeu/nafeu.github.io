I am a young innovator with a versatile set of skills in full-stack application development, UI/UX design, music production and digital content creation. I am passionate about software craftsmanship, edutech, data visualization, API economy, and open-source technologies.

Here are some fast facts:
  - I like to play competitive first-person shooters like CS:GO and Overwatch and I practically grew up on Doom and Unreal Tournament 99 (feel free to add me on Steam: [PhraktureMusic](https://steamcommunity.com/id/f1r3freak))
  - I've been making progressive breaks, liquid drum'n'bass and IDM using Cubase under the artist name [Phrakture](http://music.phrakture.com) since 2006 and have recently begun making more indie electronic music under the artist name [Nafeu](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NhwrCkzOykT6SdxGzwEtL?si=zgwxIaxsS2iIFZZ8GYvuuQ)
  - I make youtube videos for performances and tutorials [here](https://youtube.com/phrakture) and silly gameplay highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCibPYDqdi5hMJbGBMoQ7Z0w/videos)

<img src="/images/music-banner.png">

I've been producing progressive breaks, progressive house, drum & bass, chill and IDM/Glitch since I was 9 years-old (2004) and have continued with my passion for music ever since. I've put out 70+ original works (including 5+ album/ep releases) under the artist name **Phrakture** and have gotten support from artists/DJs like Jaytech, Solarstone, Matt Darey, Andy Moor, and more [(here is a shoutout from Solarstone himself)](https://soundcloud.com/springtube/slang-and-technodreamer-hypnosis-phrakture-remix-support-by-solarstone).

More recently, I've been releasing indie-electronic, nusoul, chilltrap and chillwave music under the artist name **Nafeu** and have had my work featured on [Chill Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbzCs9eiy0Q).

I've done some contracted work for [Flixel](https://flixel.com/), producing music for their videos [Lindsey Adler Shoots a Wedding Cinemagraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT1Jn86r-C4) and [The Flixel Startup Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__gRRRjhhaw). I've also contributed a custom percussion pack for [ORION: Step Sequencer](http://echocollectivefx.com/product/orion-drum-machine), created a ton of midi controllerism, beatboxing, performance, and production tutorial videos on my YouTube channel [youtube.com/phrakture](https://youtube.com/phrakture), and released a few free sample packs on [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/Phr4kture/). I have also been featured on [OverClocked Remix](https://ocremix.org/) for my remix of ["Foregone Destruction"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR01976) from the Unreal Tournament Soundtrack.

My main DAW is Cubase but I heavily incorporate Ableton for sound design. I specialize in warm melodies, deep 5th & 7th chord atmospheres, glitch edits and layered basslines. I'm a frequent user of some of the classic Native Instruments VSTs like Pro-53, FM8, Reaktor, Battery, Massive, etc. I also love incorporating live guitar, vocals, and field recordings.
