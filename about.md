I am an innovative and creative thinker with a passion for challenging work in cloud, full-stack software development, design, UX, and open-source technologies. I'm a strong communicator and presenter with hands-on experience building robust web applications, modern front-end UIs, complex API integrations and realtime applications that communicate across a multitude of technologies. I am comfortably versed in continuous integration and test-driven development practices.

I also love reading, creating generative art in Processing, making music and playing video games, here are some quick facts:
  - I like to play competitive first-person shooters like CS:GO and Overwatch and I practically grew up on Doom and Unreal Tournament 99 (feel free to add me on Steam: [PhraktureMusic](https://steamcommunity.com/id/f1r3freak))
  - I've been making progressive breaks, liquid drum'n'bass and IDM using Cubase under the artist name [Phrakture](http://music.phrakture.com) since 2006 and have recently begun making more indie electronic music under the artist name [Nafeu](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NhwrCkzOykT6SdxGzwEtL?si=zgwxIaxsS2iIFZZ8GYvuuQ)
  - I make youtube videos for performances and tutorials [here](https://youtube.com/phrakture) and silly gameplay highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCibPYDqdi5hMJbGBMoQ7Z0w/videos)

**Introspective Code** is a code mentorship, hobbyist and networking community which was brought together by myself and one of my greatest mentors (who happens to also be my older brother) [Shahriyar Nasir](https://snasir.ca/about/). The community emerged in early 2014 when I noticed a few close friends of mine were seeking a common form of hands-on guidance in full-stack web and application development. The cohort that formed was a mix of 2nd year Computer Science, Statistics and Computer Engineering students from University of Toronto who at the time were seeking (or had just entered) their first serious software internship.

Since Shah had already graduated from University of Toronto's Computer Science program and had a few years of software engineering experience under his belt, he offered his time and expertise to help us get our feet off the ground. For the next few months he organized/led workshops for us which he hosted in his office building's meeting space at [Nulogy](https://nulogy.com/).

Half a decade later, students and friends from our cohort now work in intermediate/senior software development positions at companies like Microsoft, Google, Scotiabank, RBC, Pelmorex Corp, 1Password, and more. Our community now mainly exists through our Slack channel where new members are joining every few months.

Honours Bachelor of Science - Double Major in Computer Science and Linguistics, University of Toronto

## <a name="music"></a>Music

<img src="/images/music-banner.png">

I've been producing progressive breaks, progressive house, drum & bass, chill and IDM/Glitch since I was 9 years-old (2004) and have continued with my passion for music ever since. I've put out 70+ original works (including 5+ album/ep releases) under the artist name **Phrakture** and have gotten support from artists/DJs like Jaytech, Solarstone, Matt Darey, Andy Moor, and more [(here is a shoutout from Solarstone himself)](https://soundcloud.com/springtube/slang-and-technodreamer-hypnosis-phrakture-remix-support-by-solarstone).

More recently, I've been releasing indie-electronic, nusoul, chilltrap and chillwave music under the artist name **Nafeu** and have had my work featured on [Chill Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbzCs9eiy0Q).

I've done some contracted work for [Flixel](https://flixel.com/), producing music for their videos [Lindsey Adler Shoots a Wedding Cinemagraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT1Jn86r-C4) and [The Flixel Startup Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__gRRRjhhaw). I've also contributed a custom percussion pack for [ORION: Step Sequencer](http://echocollectivefx.com/product/orion-drum-machine), created a ton of midi controllerism, beatboxing, performance, and production tutorial videos on my YouTube channel [youtube.com/phrakture](https://youtube.com/phrakture), and released a few free sample packs on [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/Phr4kture/). I have also been featured on [OverClocked Remix](https://ocremix.org/) for my remix of ["Foregone Destruction"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR01976) from the Unreal Tournament Soundtrack.

My main DAW is Cubase but I heavily incorporate Ableton for sound design. I specialize in warm melodies, deep 5th & 7th chord atmospheres, glitch edits and layered basslines. I'm a frequent user of some of the classic Native Instruments VSTs like Pro-53, FM8, Reaktor, Battery, Massive, etc. I also love incorporating live guitar, vocals, and field recordings.
